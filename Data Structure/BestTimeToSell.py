# Problem : 121

# Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
# Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0 #Buy
        right = 1 #Sell
        max_profit = 0

        while right < len(prices):
            currentProfit = prices[right] - prices[left]
            if prices[left] < prices[right]:
                max_profit =max(currentProfit,max_profit)
            else:
                left = right
            right += 1
        return max_profit
